  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is one of the most famous pasta dishes from Roman cuisine. This authentic Italian Carbonara
    recipe is made with just five simple ingredients: spaghetti, crispy guanciale, black pepper, Pecorino Romano, and
    eggs.</p>

  <p>The secret to authentic Carbonara lies in using high-quality ingredients and following the original Roman method.
    You don’t need anything else—no cream, no milk, no garlic, no onion, no pancetta, no bacon. The traditional recipe
    is all about simplicity and balance.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>350 g (12 oz) spaghetti (traditionally used for Roman Carbonara)</li>
    <li>200 g (7 oz) guanciale (Italian cured pork cheek)</li>
    <li>4 eggs (1 egg per serving)</li>
    <li>100 g (about 1 cup) finely grated Pecorino Romano DOP</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <p>
    Step 1) - First, bring a pot of water to a boil while you get the carbonara sauce ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cut the guanciale into small pieces—cubes, slices, whatever you prefer. Cook it in a skillet over medium heat for
    2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally so it cooks evenly. Once the guanciale is ready, turn off the heat, and set it
    aside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> The longer you cook the guanciale, the crispier it gets as the fat melts. You can decide how crispy or
    soft
    you want it—some like it golden and crunchy, others prefer it tender. No need for oil—guanciale is already rich and
    flavorful!
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 2) - Now, let's make the pecorino cream. In a bowl, whisk together the whole eggs and finely grated Pecorino
    Romano until smooth and creamy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> Pecorino Romano is the only cheese recommended for an authentic carbonara recipe. It’s naturally salty
    and
    packed with flavor, so there’s no need to add extra salt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 3) - Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork - or a hand whisk - until you have a
    creamy sauce.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 4) - This egg and pecorino cheese sauce should be thick and creamy. Set it aside for now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Salt the boiling water (about 10 g per liter) and cook the spaghetti al dente according to package instructions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> If your pot is big enough, the spaghetti should fit without breaking. It’s best to keep them whole so
    they can
    be easily twirled around your fork—no spoon needed! To cook spaghetti without breaking them, hold the bunch upright
    and gently lower them into the boiling water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 5) - Using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready. Transfer the hot spaghetti directly to the
    skillet with the guanciale.Toss briefly OVER HIGH HEAT to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.
  </p>


  <p>
    Step 6) - When the spaghetti and guanciale are sizzling in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT—otherwise the eggs will cook
    too much, and you'll end up with scrambled eggs instead of a creamy carbonara!
  </p>

  <p>
    Right away, pour the egg and pecorino mixture over the hot pasta and stir quickly. Since the pan is no longer on
    the
    heat, the eggs will cook gently, creating a smooth and creamy texture without lumps.
  </p>

  <p> Keep an eye on the consistency—it should be velvety, not too runny:</p>

  <p>
    TIP: If your carbonara looks too watery, simply mix in a bit more grated pecorino cheese. If it seems too thick or
    sticky, add a tablespoon or two of pasta water to loosen it up. And if you have drained your spaghetti with a spoon
    instead of a colander, that reserved pasta water will be useful for this tip!
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 7) - Authentic spaghetti carbonara is ready! So, with the help of a ladle and a fork, create a pasta nest and
    place it on a plate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Step 8) - Add the guanciale (what's left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper and grated pecorino romano to
    taste. Serve and enjoy!
