  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Sicilian Orange cake is a very soft, fragrant and easy to make cake. It's perfect for any occasion, but is a real
    treat with a cup of tea or coffee. You can make Sicilian orange cake all year round, but in the fall and winter,
    when oranges are at their best, it tastes even better.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Italian dessert recipe has its roots in the Sicilian tradition. In Sicily they call this cake "Pan
    d'Arancio".
    Oranges are one of the main products of Sicily and are present in many Sicilian recipes both sweet and savory. The
    quality of Sicilian oranges is famous all over the world and the oranges are a real richness for this region.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> 3 medium eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li> 200 g (1 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
    <li> 100 ml (8 tablespoons) of vegetable oil such as Grapeseed oil</li>
    <li> 1 big orange (or 2 small), about 300 g (10 oz), better if organic</li>
    <li> 200 g (1 ¼ cups) of "00" flour</li>
    <li> 100 g (1 cup) of almond flour </li>
    <li> 16 g (4 teaspoons) of baking powder</li>
    <li> powdered sugar, for decoration</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Equipment</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Electric stand mixer</li>
    <li>Electric hand mixer</li>
    <li>Peeler</li>
    <li>Electric food processor</li>
    <li>Round cake pan with removable bottom (22 cm / 9 inch diameter)</li>
    <li>Cake Stand with Dome</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Wash the orange really carefully. If you're not sure if it's an organic orange, we recommend rubbing the
      peel with baking soda and then rinsing.
    </li>

    <li>
      Cut the orange with the peel into pieces, removing any seeds. Put in a food processor and blend everything until
      smooth and set aside.
    </li>

    <p>
      PLEASE NOTE: As we have said, a little bitter note is characteristic of this cake. We will follow the procedure of
      the
      traditional recipe which involves blending all the whole orange. But we recommend to use a thin-skinned orange
      that
      have little white part. Otherwise, we suggest removing the orange zest with a potato peeler, then removing the
      bitter
      white part, finally blending the pulp with just the orange zest.

      This process is a bit more time consuming but necessary for the success of the cake which otherwise may be too
      bitter!
    </p>

    <li>Put the eggs with the sugar in the mixer. Mix well for about 5 minutes until the mixture is light and
      fluffy. Then add the seed oil a little at a time.</li>

    <li>
      Now add then the orange puree, mixing well on medium speed without turning off the mixer. Add the sifted
      flour a little at a time and continue to work with the mixer. Finally add the almond flour and the baking
      powder.
    </li>

    <li>
      Pour the mixture into a round springform pan with a diameter of 22 cm (9 inch) covered with parchment paper.
    </li>

    <li>Place in a preheated oven at 180°C (350 ° F) for about 40 minutes. Check the cooking with a toothpick.
      Remove from the oven and let it cool. Decorate with icing sugar.
